# Linear-Regressions

Linear Regression is a <b>Supervised Machine Learning</b> algorithm.It has different types:
1. Simple Linear regression.
2. Multiple Linear regression.
3. Polynomial linear regression.


### Simple linear Regression

It is a simple linear regression in which we have only 1 independent and dependent feature.
It works on the equation:-

<b> y = mx + c </b>

Where, y = Output feature
       m = Slope of the line.
       c = intercept.
  
  
 ### Multiple Linear regression
 
 It is same as Simple Linear Regression.But the differnce is that it has multiple independent feature when compared to simple linear regression having only 1 independent feature.
 It works on the equaion:-
 
 <b> y = m1x1 + m2x2 + ......... + mkxk + c </b>
 
 Where, mi = Slope of ith feature line
       xi = Feature point
       k = Number of feature
       c = Intercept
